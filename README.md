# betModel
A betting model for NBA player props, developed in Python

This model is an example of my ability for Python coding (specifically, data analysis with Pandas). To run it, you most install the Python package `nba_api` with the command `pip install nba_api`.

**This code is intended as a demonstration for potential employers only.** I am not responsible for any losses one might incur if it were used to place actual bets. Please gamble responsibly, never wager more than you can comfortably afford to lose.
