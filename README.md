# betModel
A betting model for NBA player props, developed in Python. There are two files, one which contains the data analysis done to determine how the model should work, and one with the model itself.

Both files are Jupyter notebooks. To run either of them without errors, you must install the Python package `nba_api` with the command `pip install nba_api`.

**This code is intended as a demonstration for potential employers only.** This model is an example of my ability for Python coding (specifically, data analysis with Pandas). Even if it were designed for professional sports betting, losses are always possible. I am not responsible for any losses one might incur if this model were used to place actual bets. Please gamble responsibly, never wager more than you can comfortably afford to lose.
